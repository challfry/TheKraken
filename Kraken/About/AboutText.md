# The Kraken is Released! #

(... yay!)

## What is The Kraken? ##

**The Kraken** is one of several client applications that work with Twitarr. This app is iOS-only, and it is only really useful when you have access to a Twitarr server, which generally means you are on a JoCo Cruise. 

## Wait, wait. What's JoCo Cruise? What's Twitarr? ##

JoCo is Jonathan Coulton. JoCo Cruise is a yearly theme cruise—in 2024 the cruise will be in the Carribbean, from March 9-16. Twitarr is a server that cruisegoers bring onto the ship, providing several social media features for cruisegoers.

Because Twitarr is on the ship, it's always available onboard, even if you don't have Internet access. However, because Twitarr is on the ship, it isn't available when ashore, even if you do have Internet access.

If you downloaded this app and **aren't** going on a JoCo Cruise, you can safely delete this app.

## Kraken Features ##

	 _…extremely large eye, large tentacles, large beak, very large fins…large everything really. It's a monster._

Twitarr has a website that I can access. Why use The Kraken instead?

 - Kraken caches all the Twitarr data it sees, which means the app is usable when not on the boat. Read your seamail, catch up on forums, check the schedule, all while sitting on the beach.
 - Additionally, you can create _new_ content when you don't have a server connection. Write new posts and seamails, edit existing ones, like/follow/favorite things, update your profile. Kraken will store the changes and send them to the Twitarr server when you get back on the boat.
 - Easily build a schedule of events you want to attend, and set local notifications so you'll be reminded. Local notifications work without Apple's Notification Servers being accessible.
 - Kraken's deck maps let you search for a room by name or number.
 - If you use alternate accounts or share your phone, you can be logged in with all your accounts at once, and switch between them with a tap.
 - There's sections for Karaoke and Board Games. Search the lists and favorite the items you may want to sing/play for handy reference later.
 - Kraken has pretty good accessibility support.
 - Take a Pirate Selfie, and share it with everyone.
 - Now with phone call support. You can call other passengers and talk to them aboard the ship, if they also have the Kraken app. 
 - Rock Ballad Mode, which shows a video of a Zippo lighter flame, has proven to be suprisingly popular.
 - New this year is Micro Karaoke, an activity where you record yourself singing one line of a song into your phone, and then later watch a music video with you in it.


## Caveats ##

Although you can create content in Kraken when you can't access the Twitarr server, you cannot log in without a server connection. So be sure to log in while aboard. If you've logged in multiple accounts, switching between them while ashore will work.

Also, you cannot create content that builds upon un-posted content while offline. This means you can draft a new Twitarr tweet, but cannot 'like' it or reply to it until it is actually posted to the server.

## Kraken Sucks! Can I stop using it? ##

Yeah. Almost all of the content is on the server. You can use the same login on the Twitarr web site, or in CruiseMonkey or Rainbow Monkey. 

The 'likes' of games, karaoke songs, and forums are stored locally as Twitarr doesn't track these. Also, if you delete the app, local notifications for Calendar events will no longer fire.

Twit-arr is a labor of love, and a large group of contributers are responsible:
- Grimoire developed the initial Status.net site that was on JCC2 and JCC3.
- Origamislayer did much work for the Status.net implementation as well.
- Glenn Basden (gbasden) graciously brings the laptop server and provides technical support.
- Nathan Walker (kvort) decided that he hated Status.net enough to rebuild the codebase for JCC4. For JCC5 he was joined in his quest 
by Emily Ozols (wingar) and James Stapleton (tasermonkey).
- RangerRick builds CruiseMonkey and integrates with the Twit-arr APIs.
- grundoon attempts to step up when needed, and did a bunch of work to prepare for JCC8.
- Dustin Hendrickson (hendusoone) fixed bugs, added features, and updated APIs for JCC9.
- Hixie wrote Rainbow Monkey, Rachel Kammerer (ralykam) worked on the user experience, and ChrisR sent in many helpful patches.
- Chall Fry (challf) wrote an iOS client called The Kraken for JCC 2020.
- grundoon, Chall Fry (challf), and Grant Cohoe (Grant) wrote Twitarr V3 for JCC 2022, with lots of help from Glenn Basden (gbasden), 
Rachel Kammerer (ralykam), RangerRick, Dustin Hendrickson (hendusoone), and Hixie.
- Drew and others at THO give tons of support and advice that allows us to continue to provide this service.
- None of this would be here without the invaluable aid of the beta testers, who try out our software on the many, MANY mobile devices 
that are out there.

A big thank you goes out to the Moderation Team for all the work they do, and to the ship's IT staff who generously host the server and allow us to run this on their network!

## Privacy ##

As mentioned in the Twitarr help section, the Twitarr API is **very** easy to snoop. Don't use a password you use for **anything** else. Don't assume any conversation you have on Twitarr is private.

This app stores your Twitarr username and hashed password token (which comes from the Twitarr server). It caches data it receives from the Twitarr server, including posts, chat texts, calendar events, images, and usernames of other users. The app will delete this data several months after the cruise ends.

Content you create with this app may be posted to the Twitarr server, and some images in the app may be shared via Apple's standard share sheet. This app doesn't send any data anywhere else.

This app has no analytics, advertising, or marketing. No data is sent anywhere for any of these purposes. It has no third party integrations that collect data of any kind, for any purpose.

This app uses Apple's ARKit technology to implement a feature where you can take photos of yourself 'wearing' a silly pirate hat. This app uses Apple's Face Tracking API to position the hat on the subject's head while framing and capturing photos. This app does not otherwise use Face Data for any purpose, nor does it store, transfer, share, or sell Face Data.
