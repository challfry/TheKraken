#  Stuff to ask the server guys

1. Multiple Logins - I think we can have multiple people logged in at the same time. There'd be 1 'active' user, who posts, but you can switch w/o logging in.
2. Server Time - Make sure my crazy device/server ideas can work.
3. OneWeeksLater feature?
4. HTTPS? Want to turn off ATS.
5. How does the alerts endpoint work with multiple devices/clients? It looks the each client would update the last_checked timestamp, leading to strange behavior.
6. For linking out to webpages, are the links canonical? e.g. "/#/stream/"
